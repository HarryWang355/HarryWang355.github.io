## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at the Graphics and Imaging Lab (GRAIL) at the University of Washington, co-advised by Prof. [Steve Seitz](https://www.smseitz.com/) and Prof. [Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman](https://www.irakemelmacher.com/).

Previously, I was a master student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I work in the [the Human Sensing Lab](http://www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/) under the guidance of Prof. [Fernando De la Torre](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ftorre/publications.html). I earned my Sc.B. Honors degree in Applied Mathematics – Computer Science from Brown University in 2023, where I was advised by Prof. [James Tompkin](https://jamestompkin.com/).
